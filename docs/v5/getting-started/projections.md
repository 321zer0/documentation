# Step 3 - Projections

When running a projection, you can choose whether the query should run and give you all results present or whether the query should continue running into the future finding new results as they happen and updating its result set.

## Setting up projections

You enable projections with the command line argument `--run-projections`. For example, the command below enables all projection modes (system and user-defined):

#### Windows

```powershell
EventStore.ClusterNode.exe --run-projections=all --start-standard-projections=true
```

To disable them again, run:

```powershell
EventStore.ClusterNode.exe --run-projections=none
```

### Linux

Add `EVENTSTORE_RUN_PROJECTIONS=All` and `EVENTSTORE_START_STANDARD_PROJECTIONS=true` to your environment variables, or the _/etc/eventstore/eventstore.conf_ configuration file and start Event Store:

```bash
sudo systemctl start eventstore
```

To disable them again, change the values to `EVENTSTORE_RUN_PROJECTIONS=none`.

### Output state

Update the projection to output the state to a stream by calling the `outputState()` method on the projection which by default produces a `$projections-{projection-name}-result` stream.
