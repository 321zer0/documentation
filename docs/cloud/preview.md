# Cloud Preview

Event Store Cloud is currently in Preview. On this page we describe what Preview means exactly.

## Why Preview?

At this stage, Event Store Cloud uses the latest available production release of EventStoreDB. It is important to understand that as part of the Preview our customers use the **production** version of our product.

The Preview stage only applies to the managed cloud. We consider it production-ready, but it lacks some important features, which we believe are necessary for the generally available (GA) product.

In order to ensure the best customer experience for early adopters of Event Store Cloud, the Preview phase is by invite only. We create organisations for Preview customers upfront and do the online on-boarding session with each Preview customer. During the session we show the Cloud console and its features, and also describe the provisioning process.

If you want to participate in the Event Store Cloud Preview program, please [register your interest](https://eventstore.com/event-store-cloud/) on the Cloud page of our website.
