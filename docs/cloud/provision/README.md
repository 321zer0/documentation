Event Store Cloud allows you to provision EventStoreDB clusters in AWS and GCP. We plan to support Azure by the end of 2020.

The provisioning process consists of the following steps:

1. Create a network in Event Store Cloud.
2. Peer the new network with your own network at the same cloud.
3. Deploy the EventStoreDB cluster.
