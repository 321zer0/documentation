## Configuring EventStoreDB

EventStoreDB can run as a single node or as a highly-available cluster. For the cluster deployment, you'd need three or more instances. The typical cluster deployment includes three nodes.

The [configuration](options.md) page explains how EventStoreDB can be configured and what additional command-line options you can use.

Follow one of the guides to configure your EventStoreDB deployment:

- [Single node](single-node.md)
- [HA cluster](cluster.md)
